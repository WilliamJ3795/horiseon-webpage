# horiseon-webpage

**Refactoring** I recfactored this existing site to make it more accessible. Making the code cleaner than it was originally whilst making sure all the application links are functional and making sure all html and css properties are organized to follow semantic structure.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
